# Face-Recognition-System
Recently face recognition has been gaining a lot of popularity in areas such as network security. In this project an automated face recognition system has been designed which identifies the face in real time. It also has special features which include blurring the faces, gender and age recognition, facial expression/emotion detection and a unique real time face makeup technique too which overall enhances the entire system of face detection and recognition. It also detects face location, but not that accurately. Face detection and recognition have become the most widely used techniques which can extract faces from an image or video an then compare it from the ones in the database to identify the people. Itâ€™s widely being used by the government for surveillance and we also see it in our mobile phones for face unlocking too. Thus by using various libraries this project has been designed keeping above scenario in mind.
